<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">On the 
airplane back to Vegas, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">All in 
mind was the pleasant days in Merritt Island</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">Rowing 
the boat under the unlimited sky,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">
Chatting our dreams in the long pier,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">
Watching the splendid sunset with dolphins swam by,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">That’s 
where I left my heart and didn’t wanna come back.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">
Teacher Ni’s merciful soul moved me day by day</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">He 
cared patient that words can’t say</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">With 
the ancient wisdom and his efforts</span></p>

4/06/2008</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">After 
reading Dr. Ni’s clinical diary on 4/05/2008, I can’t help to sing one song from 
Peter, Paul &amp; Mary:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">Lemon 
tree very pretty and the flower is so sweet</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">And 
the fruit of the lemon is planted with herbal tea</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">Lemon 
tree very pretty and the flower is so sweet</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">So the 
fruit of the lemon is incredibly BIG!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">
5/10/2008</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">From 
the email this morning I heard that my grandma is in ICU with ascitis, lung 
infection, difficult breathing, etc. If I could take her to see Dr. Ni, maybe 
she won’t suffer for 13 years and yet in this situation. I was really depressed 
and thought of other patient I met in Dr. Ni’s clinic.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">All of 
the patient I met there is still vivid…..</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">The 
stomach cancer patient happily came back from vacation in Hawaii with “Aloha” 
shirt on. He has been treatment with chemo, surgery and yet the doctor wanted 
to “sell” him $80 pill taken every day for the last three month of his life 
expectancy. And now after taking herbal medicine for nine months, he sat in the 
treatment room and told us the western doctor can’t find any cancer cell on 
him. His smile is even vivid in front of me! There was another young man came 
in with one side numbness and the other side with a shaking leg. Only after the 
first week of medicine and two acupuncture treatment, he looked normal already. 
Dr. Ni even modeled how he came in with the shaking leg, that’s was made the 
whole room full of laughter!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">Dr. Ni 
grasped the main problem of each patient in a short time. His friendly attitude 
and gesture, made all the patient felt safe and welling to express themselves. 
He has so many ways to examine the diagnosis such as eye, ear, reflection point 
check, etc. He also used different strategies to lead each patient like a great 
master! Sometimes, Dr. Ni is strict and cut patient’s words short; sometimes, 
he is like a patient daddy, explained details and theory thoroughly. I admire 
his passion for seeking new routes of remedy; I admire his courage to stand up 
and fight with pharmaceutical companies; I admire his wisdom to decode the 
Traditional Chinese Medicine for we students; I also admire his compassion to 
save all the suffering people. </span><span style="font-family: 新細明體">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">He 
is always studying, thinking and learning!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -6.0pt; margin-left: 6.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">Probably people meant to 
meet each other in the last lives and this one. I was blessed to meet him and 
especially had this opportunity for the internship with Dr. Ni for a week.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -6.0pt; margin-left: 6.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Book Antiqua">I am happily loaded with 
ancestor’s wisdom, Dr. Ni’s blessing and now the journey has just begun!</span></p>
