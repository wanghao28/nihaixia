<p ALIGN="CENTER">CHEST PAIN PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine has many sophisticated machines and tests available to help 
them determine if a heart attack may be imminent. Unfortunately, even with the 
most sophisticated medical technology available today, cardiologists cannot 
accurately predict heart attacks. A chest x-ray and blood test are routinely 
performed to help Western Medicine diagnose the cause of chest pain. If angina 
is suspected, an electrocardiogram and stress test may be scheduled to assist 
with their diagnosis.</p>
<p>Treatment for chest pain often includes the use of aspirin or blood thinning 
drugs. Angina attacks are treated with medications such as beta blockers or 
calcium channel blockers. A catheter with a balloon on its tip (angioplasty) may 
be used on a segment of an artery that is narrowed. Coronary artery bypass 
surgery may be performed if the left main coronary artery is blocked or if 
several major arteries are diseased.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine has diagnostic methods to differentiate the 
different causes of heart pain without the use of radiation or blood tests. A 
pain which runs from the chest to the back and from the back to the chest is one 
particular type of chest pain. Excessive thick fluid which encloses the 
pericardium is the root cause of this type of heart disease and cannot be seen 
on x-rays. This type of chest pain is a warning sign of a special type of heart 
disease (nor coronary artery disease). If an individual allows this symptom to 
run its course for a year, this disease will invariably lead to a heart attack.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine treats this particular type of chest pain with 
natural herbal medicines. Herbal medicines are used to eliminate the thick fluid 
around the pericardium and to strengthen the heart. By correctly diagnosing the 
problem, chest pain can be eliminated without the harsh side effects of drugs or 
invasive surgical procedures.</p>
