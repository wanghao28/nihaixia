</font></b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">A brief discussion by Lawrence Brown AP1279</font></p>
<font SIZE="4">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Eating in accord with the Dao can help you gain better
health and avoid many of the problems that are so prevalent in society today. By
simply reversing the meals, avoiding excessive junk foods, and eating a balance
of the five flavors and five colors, you can greatly reduce the chance that you
will get diabetes, high cholesterol, acid reflux, and many of the other problems
that plague people toady. When reversing the meals you should not eat or drink
anything except water after about 6pm. If you are getting hungry later on, the
hunger is usually a sign you ate too late, too heavy, or too much.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Every organ in your body has a time when it wants to be
active and a corresponding time at the opposite end of the 24 hour clock that it
needs to rest, just like you do. If you eat a late and/or large meal you do not
allow the organs in your body to have the cycles of work and rest they want.
They are born to do their jobs, but when you force them to work 24/7 by eating
inappropriately, sooner or later they will go out on strike or be forced to take
sick days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Breakfast does not mean take a fast break, it means break
your fasting (~12+hours<i>). What happens to food in a warm moist environment?
It rots! What is your stomach? It is a warm moist environment.</i> So any food
that remains in your stomach at night will just rot. Even wood in the right
environment will rot and produce methanol, which is a poison to humans. The
rotting also turns much of the food into simple sugars. Since you are not
active, the sugar is not being used up very fast. When you are laying down with
food in the digestive system, the food is pressing back up into the esophagus,
which combines with the gasses from the fermentation process to cause
regurgitation, belching or acid reflux.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> The spleen, which includes the pancreas, wants to be most
active doing its job of transforming and transporting the food you eat during
the early hours from approximately 9am to 11am. The stomach wants to be most
active from 7am to 9am, so, if you put the largest and heaviest (like meat) meal
into the fuel tank in the morning, your body will be best able to handle it. The
greatest part of the nutrition and energy in the food will be available for the
spleen to process during its most active time, giving you the fuel to get
through the journey of the day. The stomach and spleen want to go into their
sleep modes at 7pm and 9pm respectively. When there is still food in the stomach
it can not rest, so it starts working extra hard, as a result you can feel even
hungrier. Eventually the spleen may decide, even though it was born to do it’s
job, it must take a vacation. So it then begins over producing insulin trying to
catch up with the sugar load and resulting in low blood sugar levels
(hypoglycemia). Now the stage is set for typical adult onset diabetes. Your
external defenses are down because you did not sleep good, or some other reason,
and you catch a flu or cold. The pathogenic factor can go right past the
weakened defenses and attack the overworked and tired spleen, which now insists
on taking a sick day. The blood sugar skyrockets, so western medicine steps in
with some form of artificial method to lower the blood sugar, which by the way
does nothing to actually remove the sugar from the body it only makes the sugar
precipitate out of the blood. Some time later the spleen says, Ok, I am
ready to work again, but finds everything to apparently be ok, so it
becomes a couch potato and Western Medicine gives you a diagnosis of diabetes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Even the western anatomy and physiology books say the
liver has some capacity to regenerate if the negative stimulus is removed. In
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the liver not only has the capacity to
regenerate, but it is also responsible for regeneration of the entire human
body. Regeneration is the Liver's primary function. The production of acid and
bile for digestion is just supposed to be a resting function/byproduct of the
regeneration activity. In a properly functioning body the liver would normally
use the little remaining sugar in the blood at night to do this function
especially during its peak activity time of 1am to 3am. When there is still food
in the stomach, the liver does not get to stop producing acid and therefore can
not do a proper job of regenerating the body. At some point, whether because you
caught the flu/cold or because of a need to do some serious regeneration, the
liver may start over producing acid to try and catch up with the digestive
process. This results in things like <a href="acid.htm">acid reflux</a> and
heart burn (see <i><a href="acid.htm">Acid Reflux &amp; Joint Pain</a></i>). The
liver also tries to take some of the burden off the spleen, by converting some
of the excess sugar to cholesterol. The over production of acid can overflow
into the blood stream eating holes in the blood vessels, especially the arteries
where the pressure is highest. The body uses some of the excess cholesterol to
plug these holes so you do not bleed to death internally, causing hardening of
the arteries. Hardened arteries can not expand properly and can be one of the
causes of high blood pressure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Do not take vitamins or consume junk foods. Vitamins do
not make up for the lack of good nutrition in junk foods. In fact taking
vitamins only worsens the problem. Vitamin C is the usual example, but the
following goes for all concentrated supplements. There are only two filters for
the blood, the kidneys and the liver. Whenever something is absorbed into the
blood it can be lost through sweat, bleeding, kidneys, or liver. If you take
one-tenth the usual amount of vitamin C your urine immediately turns yellow. The
first thing is you are just flushing your money down the drain. Next is that you
put a heavy and unnecessary burden on your kidneys. All that excess nutrition
can be used to make stones or feed the <a href="flies.htm">flies</a> (see <i><a href="flies.htm">Flies
in the Living Room</a></i>). And finally, whenever a large amount of a reactant
is placed in a chemical equation, the other reactants for that equation are used
up trying to establish a new equilibrium, reducing the amount of the other
reactants that are available for other chemical reactions. If you consume
oranges all day long, your urine will never change color because Mother Nature
put everything you need in the orange with the vitamin C, this includes some
fiber to help remove any old nutrition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Eating a balance of the natural five colors and natural 5
flavors will theoretically provide 100% of the nutrition your body needs. The
five colors are green, red, yellow, white, and black. Sour, bitter, sweet,
pungent, and salty are the five flavors. This does not include things like red
dye #7, ordinary table salt, or distilled vinegar. You should use evaporated sea
salt or salt from other natural sources because they contain elements other than
sodium and chlorine, like magnesium. The last time I was able to find numbers
for the so-called ‘light’ salts they were still higher in sodium than sea
salt. Until relatively recently, humans used natural salts and is still what our
bodies need for a proper chemical balance. Food should be salted during the
cooking process to allow that chemicals to combine before entering the body.
This also means eating much less sweet flavor, like refined carbohydrates, and
more sour and bitter for most Americans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> So to reduce or eliminate many of your health problems and
make our job easier, you should eat like a king for breakfast, a prince for
lunch, and a pauper for diner. Eat light easily digested foods for the last
meal. Eat and drink nothing but water after about 6pm. And eat a balance of the
natural flavors and colors. Of course there are other pathways and mechanisms
that can cause these problems, but this is by far the most common cause.</font></p>
