<p ALIGN="CENTER">UTERINE PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that the cause of uterus cancer is due to an excess 
of estrogen hormones. Diagnosis is made by examining a sample of the uterine 
lining from a biopsy or scraping of the lining of the uterus. Presently, western 
medicine must wait until cysts or tumors have formed in the uterus or ovaries 
before treatment can begin.</p>
<p>Treatment with Western Medicine includes using surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiation to eliminate the cancer. These therapies unfortunately cause 
detrimental side effects, and in some cases, death results. With the treatments 
available with Western medicine, the damage done in many instances is worse than 
the disease itself. Western Medicine believes Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is 
caused by an imbalance of hormone levels which occur during the menstrual cycle, 
or from nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that uterus cancer is caused primarily 
from the flu, or from damage to the heart and/or small intestine. When a flu is 
contracted during the period, it disrupts the flow of the menstrual cycle with 
it¡¦s hot or cold temperature. As a result, residual blood nutrients deposit in 
the uterus which sets the stage for cancer to develop. Traditional Chinese 
Medicine does not advocate the use of antibiotics because of the damage it 
causes to the heart. Pain killer drugs are also to be avoided because they will 
damage the small intestine. When chemical drugs deposit in the liver, a 
decreased blood supply to the uterus results. Traditional Chinese Medicine 
believes that when the body¡¦s water and blood circulation are functioning 
properly, no deposits of old nutrients can occur.</p>
<p>Treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine includes using herbs to help the 
blood flow, to dissolve old residual nutrients, and to increase the heat in the 
heart and small intestine. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes females in good 
health should not experience PMS. PMS is actually an early warning alarm of 
residual blood nutrients depositing in the uterus.</p>
