  <p align="center"><b>ELDERLY MEMORY PROBLEM</p>
  </b>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Western Medicine</b> has linked Alzheimer・s disease and other types of 
elderly memory problems as ．senility・. They believe that there are many 
different types of dementia (madness/ insanity), with Alzheimer・s being among 
the most common type. They believe that the disease is related to the 
degeneration of brain cells, or that it is genetic since it tends to run in 
families. Other diseases must be ruled out before they make a presumptive 
diagnosis of senility or Alzheimer・s disease. These include thyroid disorders, 
alcoholism, tumors, infection, nutritional deficiencies, hardening of the 
arteries, stroke, anemia, or the side effects of drugs. Western Medicine does 
not know the actual cause of senility disorders or Alzheimer・s disease.</p>
<p>Treatment options with Western Medicine are limited. Unfortunately, patients 
with senility and Alzheimer・s will be required to be cared for by caregivers 
or family members to help perform simple tasks on a long term basis. Advice will 
be given on how to keep the home uncluttered to improve safety and to keep 
things in the same place so the patient does not need to lean anything new. 
Patients are usually given identification bracelets indicating their condition, 
name, address, and phone number.</p>
<p><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine</b> understands that memory and proper 
maintenance of brain tissue is dependent upon the Kidneys. The Kidney・s 
produce bone marrow, and proper nutrients are delivered to the brain through the 
spinal bone marrow. Unnatural, chemical drugs are difficult for the kidney・s 
to eliminate. When chemicals cannot be completely eliminated, the Kidney・s are 
adversely affected and thus cannot send good nutrients to the brain for memory. 
Considering most people are on long term drugs for years, one can see the 
detrimental long term results. Since Traditional Chinese Medicine understands 
the cause of the problem, it is very effective in treating it.</p>
<p>Treatments with Traditional Chinese Medicine will help detoxify and 
strengthen the Kidney・s so good nutrients can be properly delivered to the 
brain. Natural herbal medicines are used in conjunction with acupuncture with no 
adverse side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that good mental 
faculties should be normal among the elderly, and that it can be achieved with 
good preventative herbals, foods, and lifestyles.</p>
