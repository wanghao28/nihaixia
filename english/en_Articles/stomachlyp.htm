<p ALIGN="CENTER">STOMACH AND LYMPHATIC PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine has many different names to describe the many different 
types of lymphatic cancers (lymphomas). One of the most common is Hodgkins¡¦s 
lymphoma, or Hodgkin¡¦s disease. Lymphoma is a general term to describe any 
cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, especially in the lymph nodes. 
When tumors arise in the lining of the stomach, it is termed gastric cancer or 
stomach cancer. There is some speculation in the Western Medicine community that 
eating pickled, salted, or smoked foods may be associated with stomach cancer. 
Unfortunately, the cause of lymphoma and stomach cancer remains unknown in 
Western Medicine.</p>
<p>If lymphoma is suspected, a biopsy will be performed to surgically remove the 
lymph node for examination and an x-ray with dyes (lymphangiogram) may be 
performed for diagnosis. If lymphoma is diagnosed, there may be additional 
tests, including blood tests, CT scans, bone-marrow biopsies, bone scans, and 
kidney studies.</p>
<p>If stomach cancer is suspected, a long flexible viewing tube will be inserted 
down the patients mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small 
intestine. In addition, a biopsy of the stomach lining will be required for 
examination.</p>
<p>Western Medicine treats Lymphoma with radiation and chemotherapy, while 
patients with stomach cancer will undergo the removal of their stomach, and if 
needed, additional treatments with radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the above mentioned problems 
result when the body¡¦s water system is not circulating properly, or when there 
are deposits of excessive nutrients in the body to feed the cancer cells. 
Patients with stomach cancer may experience vomiting large amounts of blood. We 
believe that bleeding should not be stopped, except in cases of trauma. When the 
body¡¦s metabolism is restored, the bleeding will stop by itself.</p>
<p>Treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine uses herbs to change the body¡¦s 
internal environment, making it undesirable for cancer cells to exist. Herbal 
medicines will warm the body¡¦s temperature to improve the water system¡¦s 
circulation. Other herbs are used to help dissolve any old bruises or deposited 
nutrition. Treatments involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy will worsen 
the condition and cause detrimental side effects.</p>
