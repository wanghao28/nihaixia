<p> There are very few people that have not heard 
about the recent outbreak of a sudden onset and very deadly respiratory condition that is 
spreading rapidly from Asia. First diagnosed in Hong Kong and then seen in China, Vietnam 
and Canada SARS has already spread to Florida. Two people who had recently traveled to 
Asia have come down with symptoms that are believed to be SARS. For the Western Medical 
Community, this is considered a viral infection infecting the lungs and respiratory 
system. The symptoms include running a fever of more than 104 F with severe chills without 
sweating, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Patients weaken quickly and 
unless their immune system is very strong, death can occur. There is no vaccine or cure 
for SARS from the Western Medical Community at this time. However this is not the case 
from the Traditional Chinese Medical viewpoint. More than 2000 years ago documentation of 
similar types of symptoms were recorded by various Herbal masters, the most noted being 
Chang Chung-Ching in his treatise on Febrile diseases arising from Cold invasion called 
the Shan Han Lun. Even though people at that time did not know about viruses then knew 
about viral produced illness. More important, Chang Chung-Ching described the symptoms 
attributed to SARS and the herbal formula to help the body eliminate the pathogen and 
treat the symptoms. The following formula Da Qing Long Tang (Major Blue Dragon 
Combination) was formulated by Master Chang Chung-Ching to treat the same type of symptoms 
that are currently being attributed to SARS.</p>

<p> The typical symptoms that would indicate 
prescription of Da Qing Long Tang (Major Blue Dragon Combination) are Exterior cold 
symptoms of chills with no sweating and high fever, body aches, irritability, and Interior 
heat signs such as thirst or yellow sputum. The following herbs are the basic formula 
first described by Chang Chung-Ching:</p>

<p>Ma Huang (Herba Ephedrae) </p>

<p>Xing Ren (Apricot Seed)</p>

<p>Gui Zhi (Cinnamon)</p>

<p>Zhi Gan Cao (Baked Licorice)</p>

<p>Shi Gao (Gypsum)</p>

<p>Sheng Jiang (Ginger)</p>

<p>Da Zao (Red Dates)</p>

<p> Properly prepared, this formula has no side effects and 
is very effective in reducing the symptoms associated with External Wind Cold and Interior 
Heat, symptoms that describe SARS. This is the basic formula that should be available from 
herbal pharmacies specializing in Chinese Herbs. It is always better to actually see a 
Traditional Chinese Medical Practitioner so that accurate diagnosing and prescribing can 
be done. The basic formula can be modified as needed for specific patient complaints 
ensuring a more complete recovery. Ma Huang is an important herbal component of this 
ancient formula. As mentioned above, if this formula is properly prepared for the 
appropriate symptoms, there are no side effects. We do not advocate the use of Ma Huang in 
any form other than as part of a properly prepared Chinese Medical formula. Ma Huang 
should not be used for the active ingredient Ephdra alone. There are over the counter 
herbal pills for weight loss that contain Ma Huang. This is an improper use of this 
important herb. Ma Huang is properly used in Chinese Medical formulas to open pores and 
produce sweat and to decrease wheezing. It should be used alone for purposes other than 
those mentioned. It should never be used for weight loss alone. Formulas containing Ma 
Huang should be prescribed by Traditionally trained Chinese Medicine practitioners for 
conditions consistent with its Chinese Medicine properties, not the properties of Ephdra. </p>

<p> Please remember that the goal of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine is to always treat the symptoms by eliminating the cause of the symptoms, not by 
controlling the symptoms or suppressing them. Whenever patients are seen with Externally 
caused symptoms (Flu) our goal is to help the body eliminate the pathogen involved. Only 
by following the Traditional diagnosing methods and prescribing formulas that match these 
symptoms can pathogens be eliminated, thereby allowing the body to return to balance and 
good health. </p>

<p> My Conclusion is SARS can be successful treated by 
Chinese medicine without side effects any Physician who like know more SARS Please let us 
know . We don't need to die because SARS.</p>
