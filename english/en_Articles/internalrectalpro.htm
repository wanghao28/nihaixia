<p ALIGN="CENTER">INTERNAL RECTAL PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that internal hemorrhoids are caused by straining 
at bowel movement, or from conditions such as cirrhosis, or during pregnancy and 
immediately after childbirth due to increased pressure in the veins of the 
intestine.</p>
<p>Diagnosis with Western Medicine requires a rectal examination. Treatments are 
aimed at easing the symptoms by using stool softeners, or suppositories with 
corticosteroids and anesthetics to reduce swelling and pain. One method of 
treatment includes grabbing the hemorrhoid with forceps, and constricting a 
rubber band around it to make the hemorrhoid wither and drop off. Another method 
that Western Medicine uses involves injecting a chemical into the hemorrhoid 
which causes fibrous tissue to grow to prevent blood flow. Complete removal of 
the hemorrhoid is another treatment option with conventional surgery, laser 
surgery, or cryosurgery (freezing the hemorrhoid off).</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that sedentary people are susceptible 
to developing hemorrhoids. Exercise helps maintain proper spleen function, and 
the spleen is the organ which controls the body・s moisture and muscles. 
Exercising helps the body・s moisture circulate, and sedentary individuals 
allow moisture to deposit in the abdomen. Accumulated moisture with rotten foods 
produces heat in the small intestine which increases gravity・s pressure to the 
large intestine. The end result is an ．infection・ on the inside/outside of 
the colon.</p>
<p>Treatments with Traditional Chinese Medicine will eliminate the excess 
moisture in the small intestine. All natural herbs are used to eliminate rotten 
food deposits in the small intestine, eliminate ．infections・, heal any 
wounds, and decrease the size of the hemorrhoids.</p>
