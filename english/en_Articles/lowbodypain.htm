<p ALIGN="CENTER">LOWER BODY PAINS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine treats pains of various etiologies with pain killing drugs. 
In some cases, surgery is used for many lower back pain and knee disorders. Pain 
killing drugs may become addictive and will over time, cause damage to the 
liver, small intestine and other internal organs.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the lower body¡¦s circulation is 
controlled by the small intestine. The small intestine also controls the body¡¦s 
vein circulation to help blood return to the body. Pains in the lower abdomen 
and legs may result if there is poor circulation or old bruises (clots) that 
remain in certain areas.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine often uses herbs to help patients with pains in 
the lower body. Herbs are used to increase heat to the small intestine, help the 
venous circulation to the heart, dissolve bruises between the muscles and 
tendons, eliminate excess fluid around internal injuries, and to increase good 
blood. Acupuncture is often used in combination with herbal medicines to speed 
recovery.</p>
<p>Acupuncture works exceptionally well to relieve all types of painful 
disorders, including pain from herniated disks causing low back pain and 
sciatica, and for helping knee pain by strengthening the joints and increasing 
good circulation. Patients who receive acupuncture treatments for pain after 
they have already had surgery of that area (knee surgery, herniated disk 
surgery) will not recover as fast as one who receives acupuncture and has 
avoided surgery.</p>
