<p ALIGN="CENTER">PAINFUL FACE PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that excruciating facial nerve pains (trigeminal 
neuralgia) may be associated with multiple sclerosis, however the cause of 
trigeminal neuralgia in Western Medicine is uncertain. Patients with trigeminal 
neuralgia may also experience facial twitching.</p>
<p>Treatment of trigeminal neuralgia with Western Medicine involves 
anticonvulsant and pain killing drugs to suppress the pain. Various shots are 
injected directly into the nerve to try to stop the pain. Treatment is difficult 
because people become resistant to the drugs or are unable to tolerate a high 
enough dose to relieve the pain. When these pain killing drugs are unable to 
relieve the pain, surgery to cut the nerves are used as a last resort. When 
facial nerves are surgically destroyed to alleviate pain, it causes permanent 
numbness to a noticeable part of the face.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that all meridian activity comes from 
the internal organs. If the internal organ¡¦s activity is insufficient for the 
meridians, or if there is a blockage in the meridians, sharp pains result. To 
heal excruciating facial pains, the meridian channels must be opened to let them 
flow. Using powerful painkilling drugs causes damage to the liver. The liver 
controls the activity of the bowels, so if constipation results after taking 
drugs, liver damage has been done.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine uses Acupuncture and herbal medicines to 
eliminate facial pains. Pain killing drugs or herbs are not used. When specific 
herbs are used to help the qi, blood, and internal organs, the meridian pains 
will resolve.</p>
