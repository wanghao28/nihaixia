<p ALIGN="CENTER">PAINFUL JOINT DISORDERS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that gout is from deposits of uric acid in the 
joints. This statement only describes gout. It doesn・t explain the true cause 
of gout. Symptoms associated with gout are reddish skin in the joint area, 
swelling, and joints that are sensitive to touch. The most commonly attacked 
joint is that of the big toe. Other joints commonly affected include the knee, 
ankle, wrist, foot, and small joints of the hand. After the second attack of 
gout, more joints often become involved and the pain becomes constant.</p>
<p>Treatment of gout with Western Medicine includes using steroid and 
painkilling drugs to control the inflammations and pain. Drugs to block uric 
acid formation in the body are also used to control the symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the cause of gout results from 
excessive consumption of sweet and greasy foods with alcohol. Alcohol alone is 
not the culprit. (Incidentally, lay people have referred to gout as a ．disease 
of the affluent・ because only the wealthy could afford rich foods). The spleen 
controls the sweet taste and the spleen also secretes grease (fats) to maintain 
the body・s temperature. Excessive consumption of sweet and greasy foods will 
cause the sweet nutrients to become acid in the body. When the kidneys cannot 
eliminate all the excess acid in the body, the acids will follow the water 
system and deposit in the joints. Drinking alcohol will allow for more uric acid 
to circulate into the joints causing painful joint symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine uses herbs to treat painful joint disorders by 
strengthening the spleen and kidneys. Additional herbs are used to ．mix・ 
with the acid in the body. This is how pain and acid can be decreased. To 
prevent gout from reoccurring, reduce the amount of sweets, greasy foods, and 
alcohol you consume.</p>
