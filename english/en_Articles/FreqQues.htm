    <p>Question</font></i><font SIZE="4">: What type of problems can be 
    treated with acupuncture?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: All types of problems have been treated with acupuncture in 
    China for thousands of years, but we normally use acupuncture for <i>now</i> 
    type problems so we can put the needles on you <i>now</i> and ask you 
    How is your problem <b><i>NOW</i></b>? We usually use herbs to 
    treat more chronic and internal type problems, but only your acupuncture 
    physician can decide the best course of treatment for you.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: How does acupuncture work?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: Acupuncture works by redirecting your body¡¦s own natural 
    energy. Once the energy is flowing properly again the pain will be gone and 
    the natural healing process can begin. We use only single use, sterile, 
    stainless steel needles, there are no chemicals on the needles and we do not 
    use them to cut or block the nerve fibers.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: How many acupuncture treatments will I need?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: Everybody is different, so the total number of acupuncture 
    treatments can not be determined in advance. Only thing we can say for sure 
    is, if you do not see some improvement after the <b>3<sup>rd</sup> </b>treatment, 
    it does not mean that acupuncture does not work, only, that for whatever 
    reason, we are currently unable to treat your particular problem so go try a 
    different acupuncture physician. It does not mean that acupuncture is not 
    good for your problem. After the third week, your physician may decide to 
    give your acupuncture points a short break to allow them to rest. If so, be 
    sure to return at the time your physician instructs.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: How do I get the best result from my acupuncture 
    treatments?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: Return for acupuncture treatment every other day until your 
    problem is completely gone. If you only get 1 or 2 treatments per week, it 
    may take your whole life ¡V you are just wasting your time and money. The 
    best result for acupuncture is when you come in as soon as possible after an 
    injury, in this case it may only take one or two treatments. Tell your 
    physician all of your health complaints the very first visit. Avoid foods 
    containing spicy or pungent flavors, any type of sesame product (meal or 
    oil), and alcohol for 48hrs after each treatment.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: Why do I need to avoid certain foods after my 
    treatment?</p>
    <p>Answer: Because the warm feeling you can get from spicy foods or alcohol 
    is good energy dispersing throughout your body. When we perform acupuncture, 
    we are directing that same energy to go to a specific place and help your 
    body heal itself. Therefore spicy and pungent foods erase our instructions 
    to your body. Sesame products cause the same effects for some reason. There 
    have been a few cases where fig products have caused a reversal of treatment 
    as well, probably because the seeds are similar to sesame seeds.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: Why are you putting the needles on the wrong side of 
    my body?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: We are not putting the needles on the wrong side! True 
    Traditional Chinese Medicine has used the opposite side to treat most 
    problems for thousands of years. Of course there are always exceptions.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: How long will I have to keep taking these nasty 
    tasting herbs?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: You will need to keep taking your herbal prescription until 
    all of your original problem(s) are gone and until you have all six of the 
    health criterions (see Six Criteria of Health). Again nobody knows how long 
    that will take. Also, just like acupuncture, if you do not see any 
    improvement after you finish all of your <b>3<sup>rd</sup></b> herbal 
    regimen (usually 1 week per regimen), it does not mean that herbs and 
    Traditional Chinese Medicine can not help you, only that we are currently 
    unable to help your particular case.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Question</i>: Do you have any herbs that I can continue to take my 
    whole life?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Answer</b>: Yes, we have an herbal supplement you can take for the rest 
    of your life if you want to, but first you need the have all six criterion.</p>
