<p ALIGN="CENTER">EXTERNAL HEMORRHOID PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicines believes that external hemorrhoids may be caused by a 
congenital weakness of the veins in the anus. Major symptoms associated with 
hemorrhoids include itching, fluid discharge, swelling, and sharp pains around 
the anus. When the pressure increases from straining to move hard feces, 
hemorrhoids may result. Hemorrhoids also commonly occur after childbirth and 
during pregnancy. Individuals who lack fiber in their diet are also susceptible 
to hemorrhoids. Western Medicine may perform a protoscopy (examination of the 
rectum through a viewing tube) when diagnosing hemorrhoids to exclude cancer.</p>
<p>Treatment involves high fiber diets, having regular toilet habits, and using 
suppositories and creams with corticosteroid drugs or local anesthetics to 
reduce swelling and pain. Prolapsed hemorrhoids require surgery. Internal 
hemorrhoids are removed by tying bands around them to cause them to whither off. 
Other treatment methods include the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze or shrink 
the veins.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that hemorrhoids occurs when there are 
excessive damp and heat conditions within the intestines. The spleen controls 
the muscles and moisture of the body. Exercising helps to maintain proper spleen 
function. Individuals who have sedentary lifestyles do not help the moisture in 
the body circulate. This moisture accumulates in the abdominals. When the rotten 
food in the digestive system creates heat, combined with the accumulated 
moisture, this sets the basis for an overall increase in intestinal pressure. 
This pressure when coupled with gravity results in an ¡¥infection¡¦ on the 
inside or outside of the colon (hemorrhoids).</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine treats hemorrhoids by using herbs to eliminate 
the ¡¥damp heat¡¦ environment to relieve the intestinal pressure. Herbs are 
also used to dry up the external hemorrhoid to help it whither and fall off. By 
changing the body¡¦s internal environment, hemorrhoids can be eliminated 
naturally.</p>
