<p>Western Medicine believes that the cause of breast cancer begins with 
hormonal influences. They believe there are risks that may contribute to breast 
cancer, such as having the first child after age 30, and having close relatives 
with a history of breast cancer. Unfortunately, Western Medicine does not know 
the exact cause of breast cancer. Western Medicine advises all women aged 40 and 
above to have a yearly mammogram, and all younger women who are considered ¡¥at 
risk¡¦. After waiting for symptoms of a breast lump, discharge or bleeding from 
the nipple, a change in the breast shape, or a change in the skin of the breast, 
a biopsy will be needed to give a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>Treatment for breast cancer with Western Medicine involves surgically 
removing the lump or cancer. In many cases, they may need to completely remove 
one or both breasts. Other treatment options include anticancer drugs, 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Most Western Medical practitioners now 
realize that giving hormone replacement therapy actually causes an increase in 
the incidence of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the nutrients in breast milk are 
the direct source of the ¡¥period¡¦. Having a normal monthly ¡¥period¡¦ is 
crucial for the milk nutrients to be eliminated from the body. Women who are no 
longer menstruating must have a good daily bowel movement so the milk nutrients 
can be eliminated. The heart keeps the breast milk in constant circulation while 
in the breasts. The heart is also responsible for sending the milk nutrients 
down to the ovary and uterus to be eliminated by the ¡¥period¡¦. Keeping good 
circulation in the breasts will prevent breast milk nutrients from depositing so 
no lumps or cancer can form.</p>
<p>Treating breast lumps or cancer with Traditional Chinese Medicine will focus 
on strengthening the Heart and Small Intestine function to help eliminate the 
old breast milk with Herbal medicines. Traditional Chinese Medicine is opposed 
to surgery, biopsies and mammograms because they are contributing factors of 
breast cancer.</p>
