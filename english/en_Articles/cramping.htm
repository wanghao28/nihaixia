<p ALIGN="CENTER">Dysmenorrhea is the term used to describe pain during or before 
menstruation. The pain can be located in the lower back, abdomen or legs. For some women, 
the pain is so bad that the woman cannot carry out normal everyday activities. 10% of 
girls absent from school each month are due to painful periods, and it is estimated that 
140 million work hours each year are lost to cramps. Western Science attributes cramps to 
either self-limiting disorders that seem to clear up on their own or some underlying 
condition that requires intervention. The most common cause is over production of a 
substance called prostaglandin. This substance is important for normal contraction of the 
uterus during labor and delivery. Too much appears to result in cramps. Endometriosis is 
another cause of Dysmenorrhea. This is a condition where uterine tissue migrates outside 
the uterus and produces cramps. Traditional Chinese Medical Theory divide Dysmenorrhea 
into two basic types Excess pain and Deficiency pain.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">EXCESS</font> syndrome. The Dysmenorrhea is caused by blood 
      stagnation. Just like a bruise hurts where you can see it, a bruise (stagnated blood) can 
      hurt deep inside. In order for blood to flow freely, Qi must guide it. This means that any 
      thing that stagnates Qi can result in blood stagnation. Cold can also cause blood to 
      stagnate. If you have a cut and want the bleeding to stop, ice can stop or slow the 
      bleeding down. Internal cold will do the same to menstrual blood. A woman experiencing 
      excess pain will find that the pain in the abdomen will be worse with pressure. Warmth 
      will make the pain better. During the menstrual flow, cramping will increase until clots 
      (stagnated blood) are passed and then the pain will decrease.</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">DEFICIENCY</font> syndrome. The Dysmenorrhea in this case is 
      caused by lack of blood and Qi depriving the uterus of nutrients. The pain is usually dull 
      and appears at the end of menstruation or even after the bleeding has stopped. A woman 
      experiencing deficiency pain will feel better with pressure on her abdomen. Her menstrual 
      flow will be pale and thin. She might be dizzy and weak.</li>

HOW TO GET BACK INTO BALANCE AND STAY THERE</p>

<p>Women experiencing menstrual pain can benefit from acupuncture. Acupuncture can 
alleviate or greatly reduce the pain she is experiencing during the Dysmenorrhea. Herbal 
treatment is necessary to correct the imbalance producing the pain. Herbs usually need to 
be taken for a couple of months in order to ensure the imbalance is gone.

  <ol>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">EXCESS</font> syndrome. If the woman’s cramps are from stagnated 
      blood, after acupuncture to relieve the pain, the woman will need to take herbs during her 
      period. Herbs then will need to be taken at the start of her next period and possibly the 
      next couple of cycles until stagnation is eliminated. The cause of the stagnation might be 
      from Liver Qi Stagnation or Invasion of Cold. In that case, the woman will need to take 
      herbal formulas in between cycles to correct the imbalance. After Liver Qi is flowing or 
      the Internal Cold is banished, the woman will need to prevent them from occurring again. 
      The biggest cause of Liver Qi Stagnation is anger and improper response to everyday 
      stress. We recommend proper breathing and Qi exercises to assist the woman in maintaining 
      proper Qi flow. Tai Qi, Qi Gong, Yoga are some of the ways women can help their Qi remain 
      balanced. To prevent against invasion of Internal Cold, it is important to balance 
      consumption of cold foods and drinks with warm soups, drinks and food. Protect yourself in 
      cold weather; wear a scarf on your neck. Be careful going from hot environments to cold 
      environments especially if you are sweating. In Florida, we see many cold invasions 
      because of sweating outside then jumping into a cold pool or going inside to 
      air-conditioned rooms. Women are especially susceptible to cold invasion during their 
      periods.</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">DEFICIENCY</font> syndrome. This type of Dysmenorrhea usually 
      occurs because of a woman is weak from a chronic illness or weak body-build. Treatment 
      consists of building the body up by nourishing herbs and diet modifications. Women who are 
      strict Vegetarians (no meat or animal products of any kind) have to be very careful with 
      their diet. Since they lose blood every month, they must find a high quality protein to 
      replace the nutrients they are losing. Acupuncture may not be as effective in decreasing 
      the menstrual pain, because acupuncture uses the person's own Qi. If the Qi is decreased, 
      there is less to work with. Herbal formulas will be needed both during and between periods 
      to build up the woman's Qi and Blood.</font></li>
