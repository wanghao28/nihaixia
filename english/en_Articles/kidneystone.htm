<p ALIGN="CENTER">KIDNEY STONE PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine understands that Kidney stones are crystals made up of 
mineral and organic substances. Unfortunately, Western Medicine has no 
identifiable cause of kidney stones in the vast majority of cases. There are 
however, some factors which Western Medicine believes may attribute to kidney 
stones. Some believe that stones result from inherited disorders or from 
excessive consumption of foods or drinks with oxalic acid such as spinach, leafy 
vegetables, rhubarb, and coffee. Metabolic disorders and diseases which result 
in too much calcium in the blood like hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma or 
hormonal disorders are also used to explain the cause of kidney stones. Western 
Medicine has to wait until the stones get big enough to cause severe pains or 
until blood is seen in the urine before kidney stones are detected. Diagnosis 
requires examining the urine to detect any red blood cells or the presence of 
crystals. Scans, X-rays, and dye injections are also used to visually identify 
the stones on film.</p>
<p>Treatment of kidney stones with Western Medicine involves the use of a 
special catheter type device to hook and drag out stones in the lower end of the 
urinary tract. Surgery or ultrasonic treatments are used to eliminate the larger 
stones. Since the small, grain like stones cannot be eliminated with Western 
Medicine, kidney stones often reoccur.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine can detect and eliminate kidney stones when they 
are virtually undetectable by Western Medicine. The body can accurately detect 
if there are any kidney stones, even if they are as small as grains of sand. 
Kidney stones will result from the excessive consumption of calcium supplements, 
Vitamin C supplements, or from drinking unfiltered tap water. Individuals who 
have kidney related disorders in which the urine is not completely eliminated 
may have an increased risk of developing stones.</p>
<p>Treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine uses acupuncture and herbs to 
eliminate kidney stones. Herbal medicines are used to allow more water to get to 
the kidneys, separate and break up existing and developing stones, and stop and 
prevent bleeding. Good preventative measures for kidney stones include avoiding 
calcium and Vitamin C supplements or pills, and drinking only good quality 
filtered water. Avoid drinking underground water and drink tea more often 
because it acts like baking soda. It neutralizes acidity in the body.</p>
