<p ALIGN="CENTER">BALDNESS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that baldness (alopecia) is mainly due to 
hereditary factors. Excessive hair loss may result from radiation treatments or 
from prescription drugs. Some Western Medicine physicians believe that hair loss 
may be associated with other health problems such as fungal infections, an 
underlying tumor, or lupus. Hair thinning is believed by Western Medicine to be 
associated with hormonal changes in the body or a deficiency of the thyroid 
hormone.</p>
<p>Western medicine may offer medications injected into the scalp to try and 
slow the process. Other recommendations may be to try hair transplants, hair 
pieces, or a wig.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the quality of head hair relates 
to the function of the kidneys. According to Chinese Medicine, the sweet tasting 
nutrients go into the spleen and pancreas. The kidneys control the hair growth 
and the entire body¡¦s skeletal system. If you eat excessive amounts of sweet 
foods, the body¡¦s salt water balance will be disrupted which creates a burden 
to the kidneys. Pharmaceutical chemical drugs will create a burden to the 
kidneys and liver. Over use of such drugs will cause hair loss.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine uses herbs to strengthen the kidneys. Herbs are 
used to strengthen the kidney, which will follow the bone marrow up to the 
brain. When it gets to the brain, it will nourish the hair. Foods and drinks 
with refined sugars in them must be avoided.</p>
