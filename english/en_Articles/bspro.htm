<p ALIGN="CENTER">BLOOD SUGAR PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes diabetes is a disease which occurs when the body 
cannot properly metabolize foods (especially carbohydrates). They believe that 
diabetes is from family genetics and other factors such as viruses, the 
environment, and being overweight, which causes the body to destroy its own 
insulin-producing cells within the pancreas. Western Medicine believes that if 
the pancreas does not release enough hormone (insulin) to convert sugar and 
starches into energy, excess sugar builds in the blood damaging blood vessels 
and internal organs.</p>
<p>Treatment with Western Medicine includes administering self-injections of 
insulin, often combined with glucose drugs. These treatments are often life long 
and unfortunately, long term use of these drugs will lead to blindness, loss of 
libido, and kidney failure. Special diets are also prescribed as part of the 
therapy. Regularly monitoring the blood sugar level and frequently seeing a 
Western Medical physician are necessary to prevent complications.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that an improper lifestyle, not 
genetics, is one reason for high blood sugar problems. The spleen receives 
nutrients from the small intestine and the spleen also sends moisture to the 
small intestine. The spleen converts excessive nutrients in the body into fat. 
Excessive fat will burden the heart. The heart provides heat so the pancreas can 
burn fat and maintain balance within the body. A chronic imbalance of the spleen 
and pancreas will lead to kidney failure. This is why all patients at the final 
stages of diabetes are on renal (kidney) dialysis machines. It is because their 
kidneys quit working. Western drugs try to control the disease but cannot 
prevent kidney failure in the end. When man made insulin is injected, the liver 
will constantly try to detoxify this substance from the body. Chronically using 
insulin causes the liver to overwork, creating eye problems since the Liver 
controls the eyesight.</p>
<p>Treating high blood sugar with Traditional Chinese Medicine involves herbs to 
strengthen the heart, liver, and kidneys. Herbal medicines will help bring the 
body¡¦s metabolism back to normal so the body itself (not insulin, a drug) can 
control the blood sugar. Avoid eating before bedtime since the body¡¦s 
metabolism slows when sleeping, and excess food in the stomach will be converted 
into sugars which over time will cause a rise in the blood sugar level.</p>
