<big>INFERTILITY</big></p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> As mentioned earlier, 
our bodies are programmed at conception to be self-repairing as well as to carry the 
ability to reproduce. If a woman's body is in balance, pregnancy should occur without 
difficulty. However, most American women are no longer in balance. The inability to become 
pregnant or to sustain a pregnancy is seen more and more often in the Industrialized 
Nations, America included. There can be numerous causes of infertility, the most common 
are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Deficiency of Jing Essence </li>
  <li>Cold in the Uterus </li>
  <li>Blood Stasis in the Uterus</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> 
DEFICENCY OF JING ESSENCE</p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> Jing Essence is a 
particular type of Qi with which we are born. We receive Jing Essence from our mother and 
father. The amount individuals have is directly related to what they were given. This 
means if our mother or father depleted their Jing essence, they would have less to give 
their children. Jing Essence can be depleted through excessive sexual activity, poor diet, 
stressful conditions, aging. Jing Essence is necessary for proper development and 
reproduction. Daughters of older parents might inherit less Jing Essence thereby 
decreasing their fertility. Jing Essence is inherited but it is stored in the Kidney. If a 
woman's kidney is deficient, Jing Essence can not be stored properly and infertility can 
result. Anything that depletes Jing Essence or does not allow proper handling of the Jing 
Essence will decrease a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. If a woman has sufficient 
Jing Essence but her Kidney is weak, a woman’s chance of becoming pregnant will also be 
decreased. Therefore abnormal Kidney function can also result in infertility. </p>

<p>A true congenital deficiency of Jing Essence will be seen in delayed development, 
physical and mental. Sometimes girls, who are late starting their periods, may be 
suffering from Jing Essence deficiency. Kidney Deficiency usually has symptoms of lower 
backache, tiredness, urinary problems, mental confusion, and memory impairment. Stress, 
improper exercise and excessive sexual activity can damage the Kidney. Excessive 
consumption of sweets can also cause problems with the Kidney function. If the Kidney is 
not able to work properly, it is not able to store and transport Jing Essence, resulting 
in reproductive difficulties. If a man, proper sperm development can be affected if Jing 
Essence is deficient; if a woman, the egg will not mature. Without a mature egg and/or 
properly developed sperm, fertilization and conception cannot occur.</p>

COLD IN THE UTERUS </p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> 
The Uterus has to provide a hospitable environment for the developing embryo. There has to 
be sufficient warmth and nutrition available for proper growth and development. If 
conception has occurred, the embryo has less than a week to implant into the uterus. 
Implantation into the uterus provides a direct link to blood vessels, which supply vital 
nutrients to the developing embryo. This link has to be maintained until the placenta is 
formed at about 3 months into the pregnancy. The Uterus has to be able to support the 
development of the fetus directly in the beginning and then by supporting the placenta for 
the rest of the entire pregnancy. Any weakness in the Uterus will result in miscarriage 
(spontaneous abortion) of the fetus. But first the Uterus has to be able to allow for 
implantation to occur. A very common cause of Infertility of modern women is invasion of 
Cold into the Uterus. Modern American women have a fondness for cold drinks and cold 
foods. We are a Nation of people who put ice into every thing we drink. Even if we live in 
warm climates, we can still be exposed to Cold pathogens, even in summer! This happens 
quite frequently because Americans don't like to sweat or to be hot. If we are outside in 
the summer months and work up a sweat what do we do? Jump into a swimming pool, go into 
air-conditioned cars or houses, drink cold drinks immediately subject our bodies to 
extremes of temperature. If we are sweating, our pores are open and our body is cooling 
down naturally. If we enter into the Cold or drink Cold drinks, our pores will slam shut 
trapping moisture under the skin. ( This leads to other problems discussed elsewhere). 
However, if a woman is menstruating, a channel has been opened directly into her womb. 
Cold has an easier time entering the body and going deep inside. Cold that invades the 
womb, will prevent an embryo from implanting or remaining the time needed to fully 
develop. Even though fertilization may occur, a pregnancy won't come to term. A woman 
usually can tell when she has Cold in the Uterus because heat feels very good when pressed 
against her abdomen. This can be heating pads or hot baths. She might also have a craving 
for hot drinks.</p>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> 
BLOOD STAGNATION</p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> 
As mentioned above, blood has to move freely within the Uterus in order for nourishment of 
the embryo to occur. Anything that stops or slows the Blood will result in Blood 
Stagnation. Blood stagnation can produce masses in the abdomen. These masses can be very 
painful to the touch. Pressure on the abdomen makes the pain worse. Masses can interfere 
with implantation of the embryo, by physically blocking the area where implantation can 
occur. If the blood isn't moving, proper nourishment won't be available even if 
implantation occurs. Blood stagnates from a number of causes. Proper circulation of blood 
according to Chinese Medical Theory depends upon the presence of Qi. The Qi has to 
circulate throughout the meridians, collaterals, muscles and vessels of the body in order 
for Blood to follow. The Liver controls Qi circulation. </p>

HOW TO GET BACK INTO BALANCE AND STAY THERE</p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW"> After an 
examination by a Traditional Chinese Medical Practitioner, the cause of the infertility 
will be determined. Treatment will be tailored to the individual woman. </p>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Jing Essence. If the cause of the infertility appears to be from a decrease in Jing 
          Essence caused by Kidney weakness, herbal formulas to strengthen the kidney will be 
          prescribed. Sometimes, the Kidney weakness can be from a condition called Excess, which is 
          easiest thought of as Kidney stones. Sometimes Diagnostic Imaging can see these stones , 
          but sometimes the stones are not radiopaque and consequently do not show up on x-rays. If 
          the stones are gravel-like substances, they may not even show up on Ultrasound images. But 
          the Traditional Chinese Medical Practitioners here can check you to determine if this is a 
          cause of your infertility. Treatment can consist of herbs and acupuncture. If the 
          insufficient Jing Essence is from a Kidney deficiency, herbal formulas can help restore 
          normal kidney functioning. It is important that lifestyle changes be effected at the same 
          time. A woman should be careful of excesses in exercise, especially during her menses. 
          Follow a proper nutritious diet. Any type of breathing/physical exercise program that 
          builds Qi will also aid a woman who is deficient in Jing Essence. If the practitioner 
          determines that the deficiency is in Congenital Jing Essence, herbal formulas will be 
          prescribed to strengthen the Kidney to conserve the inborn Essence. </li>
        <li>Cold In the Uterus. After an examination, if the Traditional Chinese Practitioner 
          determines that the woman is suffering from Internal Cold, herbal formulas to warm the 
          Uterus will be prescribed. To prevent cold invasion, women should be very careful not to 
          consume cold drinks or cold food during the menses. Cold food are raw fruit and 
          vegetables. If you are a vegetarian, you must be very careful to balance your consumption 
          of Cold foods with warming soups, teas and high quality protein. We recommend consumption 
          of warming meats or meat broth during menses to those who can eat meat, fish or fowl. If a 
          woman contracts a flu or cold during her period, immediate attention is required to 
          prevent the pathogen from going deeper into the body. </li>
        <li>Blood Stagnation. After an examination, if the Traditional Chinese Practitioner 
          determines that the woman is suffering from Blood stagnation, acupuncture and/or Herbs 
          will be prescribed. Blood stagnation in the Uterus can result in menstrual cramping. If a 
          woman comes to the practitioner during menstrual pain, acupuncture can be done to relieve 
          the cramps. Herbs are prescribed to break up the stagnation. Normally, herbal formulas 
          must be taken for a couple of cycles to insure cleansing of the stagnations (clots). A 
          woman should take the herbs a day or so before her menses starts and continue throughout 
          the period. She might notice a heavier than normal bleeding the first couple of cycles 
          after starting the herbs as the stagnations are removed. This is why some women's cramps 
          decrease after childbirth, the stagnations come out with the afterbirth. Once the 
          stagnations are removed, it is important that the woman not produce more. There can be 
          many causes of stagnation, but the most common one in America is Liver Qi Stagnation. 
          Anger and toxins can damage the Liver producing Qi stagnation. Careful attention to what 
          we eat can help reduce toxin intake. Avoid foods with high levels of additives. Decrease 
          the burden on the Liver by consuming alcohol in moderation and use Liver-cleansing herbs 
          to assist the Liver in detoxifying the blood. Vitamin and Mineral supplements can also be 
          a burden to a Liver that has Qi Stagnation. We recommend proper exercise to reduce the 
          stresses of modern life. Proper exercise is a combination of breathing and movements to 
          stimulate Qi production and movement. Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Meditation, Yoga are all forms of 
          exercise designed to decrease Qi stagnation and cultivate Qi. It will also help if 
          stressful situations can be avoided. If one can not avoid stress, herbal formulas will be 
          needed to assist the body in preventing Liver Qi Stagnation.</font></li>
