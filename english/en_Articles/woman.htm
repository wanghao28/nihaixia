<p> 
<big> TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE AND A WOMAN'S PERIOD</big></p>

<p> The Human body 
is programmed from conception to be a self-healing living organism. If you cut yourself, 
your cut heals. It may heal quickly or slowly depending upon your immune status, but it 
will heal. Western Science Medicine cannot heal you; it only tries to assist your body in 
healing itself. It isn't very successful when dealing with patients that are very weak; 
bed sores (decubitis ulcers) is one type of wound that defeats the arsenal of modern 
medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine is more successful because we first strengthen the 
patient's immune system making it possible for the body to do what it does best, i.e. 
heal. Traditional Chinese Medicine also believes that a normal healthy body should 
function as it is designed to do. This is especially true for women. The female body is 
programmed to undergo monthly cycles of hormonal fluctuations to prepare for fertilization 
of her egg and the support of a healthy pregnancy. Women should not experience mood 
swings, bloating, constipation, cramping, irregular menstrual cycles, abnormal bleeding or 
infertility. American women appear to be especially prone to abnormal menstrual cycles and 
what has been coined Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). A healthy woman should not experience 
the pain and discomfort associated with the monthly cycle that currently is the norm with 
most American women. As late as the 1960's Western Science Medicine agreed. 
However, their answer was that any woman who experienced cramping and pain with her cycle 
had mental problems. It wasn't until more and more female MDs started experiencing these 
problems that it became more accepted that sane, normal women could have some sort of 
malfunction in her reproductive system resulting in abnormal cycles, abnormal bleeding, 
pain and cramping, PMS, etc. But why did these problems begin? Most women accept PMS each 
month, cramping, heavy bleeding, etc. There are a variety of Western pharmaceuticals and 
Western Herbal products directly geared toward female menstrual problems. But none of 
these address the reason why these problems are suddenly so prevalent. The treatments 
offered by Western Science and even Western Herbs only seek to mask the symptoms of 
menstrual abnormalities. So each period presents with the same (or worsening) symptoms. 
The woman who suffers each month must live on pain killers, period regulators, seek 
surgery or wait for menopause. But even then, she will most likely be hit with even worse 
symptoms as menopause approaches. Most women will start with drugs or herbs to 
try to control the pain and other symptoms. Generally as the symptoms worsen, women will 
return to their GYN so often that eventually, the GYN will suggest a laparoscopic 
examination, maybe a D &amp; C, maybe a hysterectomy, all because a normal process that 
should proceed with little or no difficulty, turns into a nightmare. Why should American 
women suffer so? Do all the women of the world suffer the same? Have women throughout 
history suffered with these symptoms? I don't believe so. I think that 
our American lifestyle has contributed to the problems that women face each month. </p>

<p> To 
understand how a normal process can go so wrong, we must first understand how a normal 
menstrual cycle should occur. </p>

<p> Western 
Medical Science tells us that the menstrual cycle starts with changes in levels of the 
female hormones. These hormones stimulate production of a woman's egg and the hormone 
Estrogen. Estrogen produces changes in the lining of the uterus and breast as well as 
stimulating maturation of the egg. After ovulation (release of the mature egg), a 
different hormone now is produced, Progesterone. Progesterone and Estrogens work on the 
uterus to prepare a suitable lining for a fertilized egg as well as working on the breast 
to build tissue necessary for production of milk. If no 
implantation of a fertilized egg occurs, the progesterone and estrogen production stops 
and uterine lining is sloughed off producing menses (period). The cycle can then start all 
over again. This cycle will continue until around age 50. When the hormone levels can't be 
maintained, the period stops. In Chinese Medical Theory, the egg has nothing to do with 
the period. The period comes from Breast Milk. White Milk is produced in the breasts. The 
milk travels down the Chong Meridian to the Uterus. As the white milk passes down the 
abdomen, the heat from the Small Intestine turns the white milk red. Good milk production 
is essential for healthy periods, as is having a Small Intestine that produces a normal 
temperature. A woman should feel the tenderness and fullness in her breasts prior to her 
menses starting. This is healthy. If blockage in the Chong meridian occurs Milk cannot 
travel downward to the uterus. If the Small Intestine is too hot or too cold, conversion 
to menses will not be normal. If the Breast Milk can not travel on the normal pathway, 
milk will go elsewhere. If the Milk enters the Heart, Lupus occurs; if Milk enters the 
Blood, leukemia; if Milk enters the Lungs, lung cancer; if Milk stays in the Breast, 
Breast cancer. Keeping a healthy flow of Breast Milk and functioning Small Intestine is 
vital for a woman's health, not just for normal periods. </p>

<p> American women are not taught proper diet or 
exercise. Our grandmothers and great grandmothers understood the importance of taking care 
of themselves during their menses. Modern women ignore these strictures as old fashioned 
or sexist. During the menses, a woman should not drink cold drinks, swim or bathe (showers 
are okay). Energy should be conserved. Hot teas and moderate exercise are important. The 
most dangerous time for a woman to contract the flu is during her period. The virus will 
go deep as the Breast Milk travels inward and downward. The flu virus will stay in the 
woman for decades and each time she has her period the flu will be reactivated. This is 
why so many women feel lousy while menstruating. For information regarding specific 
complaints unique to women, please go the appropriate site. </p>
