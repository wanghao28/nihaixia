<p ALIGN="CENTER">JOINT INFLAMMATION PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that arthritis (inflammation of a joint) is due to 
the degenerative effects of aging (osteoarthritis), or from an autoimmune 
disorder in which the body¡¦s immune system acts against the joints and 
connective soft tissues (rheumatoid arthritis). The exact cause of arthritis is 
unclear in Western Medicine. These types of arthritis are considered incurable 
diseases. Over time, the joints of the hands or feet will become very painful, 
stiff, and deformed. Diagnosis is made by inserting a needle into the affected 
joint and withdrawing fluids to be examined microscopically for the presence of 
crystals, uric acid, or microorganisms. Blood tests may be performed to 
determine the high level of rheumatoid factor. X-rays may also be performed to 
reveal the extent of the joint damage.</p>
<p>Treatment with Western medicine involves a combination of rest, special 
exercises, joint protection, and medications. Strong pain killing drugs and 
steroids are often used to relieve the symptoms of pain and inflammation. 
Diseased joints that have become extremely painful, deformed, or unstable may 
require replacement of the joints with artificial substitutes or by fusing bones 
together.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that when the body perspires, cooling 
down should be done naturally. Cooling down with air conditioners and cool water 
does not allow the body to naturally perspire. When this occurs, the skin pores 
shrink, leaving the ¡¥sweat¡¦ inside the skin. In the beginning stages, itchy 
skin results, followed by muscle cramps and swelling, nausea, and finally 
soreness and swelling of the joints.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine treats joint inflammation and pain by using 
herbs to eliminate the excess moisture in the body from perspiration. 
Acupuncture is used to improve the circulation and eliminate pain in the joints. 
Lifestyle behaviors of unnaturally cooling down must be changed. Interestingly, 
this is how certain people with arthritis are sensitive to seasonal changes.</p>
