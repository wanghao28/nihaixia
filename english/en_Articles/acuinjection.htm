<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><big>A critical evaluation</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If injection of herbs or other substances was 
necessary for successful treatment of patients, Oriental medicine consisting of 
Acupuncture and Herbs would never have survived the thousand years plus that it has. 
Obviously, acupuncture injection therapy is a relatively recent development. Does it 
signify an improvement in Acupuncture treatment therapy? Does it have any legitimate role 
in patient treatments? If a legitimate role is present, who should be performing 
acupuncture injection therapy? What kind of training is necessary for those who perform 
acupuncture injection therapy? How can the patient (consumer) be protected from possible 
side effects from acupuncture injection therapy? Should medical malpractice for 
acupuncturists be increased if they perform acupuncture injections? Will medical 
malpractice be increased for acupuncturists who don¡¦t perform this specialized therapy? 
Unfortunately these questions were not adequately addressed when the Florida Board of 
Acupuncture passed the rule allowing Licensed Acupuncturists who had completed 60 hours of 
training to perform acupuncture injection therapy. We think that these issues do need 
answers and have offered here what information we could find from the existing literature.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We think it is important to point out that in China 
Acupuncture training is not the same as here in the United States. There is far more 
intermingling of Allopathic Medicine with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It is not 
uncommon for allopathic practitioners in China to receive further training in TCM so that 
there remains strictly allopathic hospitals where MDs practice; there are also hospitals 
where TCM practitioners with allopathic training practice. At these hospitals you can also 
find MDs with TCM training. Treatments involving parental delivery of medication 
(injections) are common in allopathic medicine. While the actual action of performing an 
injection is easily learned (patients are routinely taught to self-administer subcutaneous 
injections) there is still training needed to order to this mode of medicine delivery. 
Injections into the muscles require special training because of the possibility of 
injection into blood vessels increases when injecting into muscles versus into fat. 
Adverse reactions can occur within seconds following injections. Anaphylactic shock 
following allergic reactions can occur. While allergic reactions to herbal preparations 
ingested or applied topically can occur, the speed and severity of reaction is greater 
when administer parenterally. Currently the Florida Board of Acupuncture requires only a 
60-hours training program to allow Licensed Acupuncturists to <b>PRESCRIBE </b>and <b>INJECT 
</b>any substance. There is no limit as to what may be injected into the patient. There is 
no provision to indicate where the acupuncturist is obtaining the substances being 
injected.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Examination of the literature from China suggests a 
wide array of substances that can be injected into the patient. (See link) It appears that 
Sterile Water or Sterile Saline can be injected into acupuncture points in order to 
stimulate the point. Needing to use an injection to produce Da Qi (the arrival of Qi) 
suggests that the acupuncturist was unable to elicit an effective response using the 
traditional needling methods. Absorption of the material will depend upon a number of 
factors including depth of injection; amount of substance injected and types of tissue 
injected into. If Da Qi is obtained with injection of water or saline, how long it would 
be maintained and the effectiveness of treatment over that of traditional needling has 
been demonstrated. Injection of water of saline into animals can bypass the need to retain 
the needles decreasing the need of extended restraints. Needling of uncooperative patients 
shouldn't be done in this country, so needles should be able to be retained for the 
appropriate length of time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Some of the other substances injected are procaine, 
which is a local anesthetic and reserpine, which has many uses and as many side effects. 
(see link) We are not sure whether the effect of injection is being sought from the 
injection into the acupuncture point or from the effect of the drug being injected. We 
find it difficult to believe that a traditional acupuncturist without an allopathic 
medical degree and license in the state of Florida, would be injecting either of these 
substances into patients. We find it difficult to believe that licensed acupuncturists in 
Florida would be able to even legally obtain these drugs to inject. These two substances 
appear to be commonly employed in acupuncture injection therapy for a variety of Western 
Science diagnosed problems in China. We are not going to debate effectiveness of treatment 
because our training is not in Western Science pathology. We can only diagnose and treat 
based on Traditional Chinese Medical theory, which does not include the use of Procaine or 
Reserpine.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Injection of herbs is also performed in 
hospitals in China. Generally the herbs are selected based on their TCM properties for the 
specific condition the patient exhibits. Chai Hui, an herb that clears Wind Heat, is 
injected intro muscular (IM) to reduce high fevers. We don¡¦t believe that many licensed 
acupuncturists would be treating high fevers in their office, or do we believe that any 
hospital in Florida would allow injection of Chai Hui for any reason into an inpatient 
that this time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> There have been studies from China comparing 
administration of herbal remedies by injection or ingestion in the treatment of specific 
conditions. Based on Traditional Chines Medicine Theory, herbs must enter the proper 
channels in order to be effective. The role of the Spleen as we all know is to Transport 
the food we consume (of which herbs are included), to the appropriate organs based on the 
properties of the food. Only then can unbalance be corrected. Injection of herbal 
solutions into the body either rely on the herbs being directly delivered to the organ or 
site of unbalance or to eventually enter the blood to be transported to where the 
acupuncturists hopes it will do the most good. Bypassing the Spleen by not allowing for 
normal digestive processing removes this critical component from the healing process. One 
study (see link) comparing these two methods in the treatment of prostitutes, did not show 
a benefit of injection of herbs over that of ingestion. How many acupuncturists in Florida 
would be using herbal injection to treat constitutional conditions? If the acupuncturist 
received training in China to perform these injections, what conditions did he/she treat? 
Where was this training done? In a hospital setting or private office setting? What 
benefit over ingestion of herbs was seen? The point we are trying to make here is why is 
it necessary to perform injections when the ingestion of herbs is so effective? We have 
heard that patients in this country do not like the raw herb decoctions. We have found 
that patients wanting to be returned to balance and regain their health will drink the 
decoctions. We have found this to be the case because as unpleasant as the decoctions can 
be, the beneficial healing effects far outweigh any unpleasantness. Herbal powders, pills 
and capsules are also effective. If the patient does not respond to the herbal remedies is 
it because of the mode of delivery of the formula selected?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If Florida Acupuncturists are administering 
Vitamins, other nutritional supplements or prescription drugs, then they have moved away 
from Traditional Chinese Medicine. If they believe they are practicing Modern Chinese 
Medicine, then they should be very careful about travelling into the waters of allopathic 
medicine. If they are allopathic practitioners also practicing TCM, they are outside the 
scope of this commentary. If however, they are licensed acupuncturists attempting to 
practice allopathic medicine under the guise of Modern Chinese Medicine, should rethink 
their position. Perhaps they would be better suited in returning to school to be properly 
trained in allopathic medicine so that injections would be more appropriate to their 
practice.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We ask the Florida Board of Acupuncture to require 
any licensed acupuncturist that is currently registered as performing acupuncture 
injection therapy to indicate to the Board the following information:</p>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>what is their background and training in addition to the 60 hours mandated by the Board 
      to prepare them to prescribe and inject substances into patients</li>
    <li>what substances have they injected and are currently injecting into their patients</li>
    <li>where have they obtained the substances they are injecting into their patients</li>
    <li>what evidence do they have that the treatments provide a benefit. </li>
  </ol>
