<p ALIGN="CENTER">DRY SKIN PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes dry, itchy skin is due to allergic, psychological, 
or hereditary reasons. Dermatologists will likely examine the skin with a 
magnifying glass and take specimens of the skin for microscopic study. Blood 
tests and a biopsy of superficial lymph nodes may be performed to help them rule 
out other diseases which could be affecting the skin.</p>
<p>Western Medicine treats dry, itchy skin by advising patients to avoid 
substances which may be triggering the problem. To keep the skin from losing 
moisture, they recommend applying lotions or oils to the affected skin areas, 
and taking iron supplements for nutritional measures. If the skin becomes 
infected, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Other drugs to control the 
symptoms of itching and pain include steroids and antihistamines. If conditions 
worsen, hospitalization may be necessary so they can rule out any strong 
irritant and to provide intensive care for the symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the skin is controlled by the 
lungs. The lungs and skin pores should breathe together when inhaling. Having 
good moisture in the skin directly relates to the quality of the moisture in the 
lungs. When the steam from the large intestine evaporates, the vapor goes to the 
lungs and the lungs then transfers it to the skin. This is why the skin is 
normally soft. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that if the temperature of 
the small intestine is too low or if there is too much mucus in the lungs, the 
water vapor in the lungs cannot spread to the skin, resulting in dry, itchy 
skin. Using steroids creates numerous side effects, one of them being that the 
pores of the skin will close. If the pores can¡¦t get water, they¡¦ll get 
drier.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine uses herbs to treat dry and itchy skin by 
increasing the temperature in the small intestine and by cleaning out residue or 
mucus in the lungs. By keeping this water channel open, we can eliminate present 
and future skin problems. It is also helpful to engage in exercise to help the 
body perspire. Avoid entering an air conditioned room immediately after 
exercising because it will close the skin pores and trap the sweat inside. Let 
the body cool down naturally.</p>
