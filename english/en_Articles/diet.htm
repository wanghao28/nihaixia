<p>Anyone who has ever visited the diet and nutrition section of a bookstore knows how 
confusing it is in the midst of the sheer number of books available. Instead of giving a 
lot of technical information here, I will discuss the <u>most practical </u>information on 
just what is a proper diet. The knowledge is gathered from countless books on nutrition I 
have studied from the natural health field. (Conventional medicine has little knowledge on 
nutrition.)</p>

<p>Instead of giving overwhelming info on what to eat, I think it is much easier to 
discuss what NOT to eat. </p>

<ol>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF SWEET FOODS (E.G., DESERTS)</li>
  </u><p>This tops the list. Americans generally eat way too much sweet foods. It isn</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">t realized that sweet foods literally damage the kidneys which in turn cause 
  hair loss in men and bone deterioration in women. Sweet foods also become ACID in the body 
  which will result in excessive stomach acid production. All sweet foods in America are 
  made with white sugar, which is the culprit in many diseases. Try to consume foods which 
  are made with natural sugars such as honey, cane sugar, and pure maple syrup.</p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID COFFEE AND SOFT DRINKS. DRINK TEA INSTEAD.</li>
  </u><p>Coffee is very acid forming in the body. Soft drinks, which ALL contain a lot of 
  sugar is just as acid forming. Don</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">t forget that coffee, soft 
  drinks, and deserts are all usually eaten together. These all are extremely acid forming. 
  Creating an acid environment in the body sets up the foundation for viruses, bacteria, and 
  cancer cells to develop. Diseases do not develop overnight, they are developed from years 
  of improper eating. What about diet soft drinks? These all contain Nutrasweet, which is 
  very bad for the body. Space limits the discussion on this harmful chemical, I advise 
  anyone interested to read more on the dangers of Nutrasweet. Green tea is an excellent 
  drink. Tea unlike coffee is ALKALINE. A healthy body should be slightly more ALKALINE than 
  acid. Tea will do that. Hot tea is like a soap for the body. It cleans out the arteries 
  and lymphatic system and neutralizes acidity. Drink tea instead of coffee for better 
  health.</p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID ANY OILS WHICH ARE HYROGENATED!</li>
  </u><p>The medical establishment I believe is very confused on the subject of fats and 
  diet. They keep saying to eat a low fat diet to prevent heart disease. Let</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">s set the record straight on this subject. </p>
  <p>To begin, humans have to have fats as part of the diet. Fats are necessary for many of 
  the metabolic processes in the body. BUT the key is to know what are good fats and bad 
  fats, not to avoid fats all together. To put it in most simplest terms, the good fats are 
  the ones that occur naturally such as butter, corn, canola, sunflower, and olive oil. The 
  oils present in fish are excellent for the body. (I believe fish and green tea are the 
  secrets for Japanese longevity.) The problem is when oils are taken to the factories and 
  so called HYDROGENATED. These oils are on every food label in the supermarket. The best 
  examples of hydrogenated oils are MARGARINE, </font>¡¥<font FACE="Arial">I Can</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">t Believe It</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">s Not Butter, and other similar 
  products. Since these oils are not from nature, and the human body is, it is impossible 
  for the body to process it. When this happens, the oils clog up the arteries and a host of 
  diseases result. For some unknown reason, this is unknown to 99.9 percent of medical 
  doctors. </p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID FAST FOODS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE</li>
  </u><p>Fast food places are NOT in the business of keeping you healthy, they are in the 
  business of making money. The oils used in cooking the foods are most likely all of the 
  hydrogenated type (because they don</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">t spoil easily). The foods 
  in fast food places are all very high in unnatural fats. They are usually high in salt and 
  to top that, people usually get a high sugar soft drink to go with the order. From what 
  you</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">ve read already, this combination does not make for good 
  health. It sets the foundation for inevitable disease in the future. Cows milk is made for 
  baby cows, NOT humans. Cows have 4 stomachs to digest the very high casein(mucus) content. 
  Humans have a very hard time digesting cow products. I believe being lactose intolerant is 
  a NORMAL phenomenon. No other animal on earth naturally drinks another</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">s milk. Only humans do. That is why humans get diseases that animals normally 
  do not get such as allergies, asthma, and sinus problems. Dairy products are very mucus 
  forming in humans. Add up all the growth hormones and antibiotics that are given to cows 
  and you have a drink very unfit for humans to drink. It is amazing to see that people 
  actually take special drugs(Lactaid) to TRY and digest dairy products. Inability to digest 
  another animal</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">s product is not the food</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">s problem, but in the person trying to ingest it! The worst thing one can do 
  is to take drugs to digest the dairy product. Instead of taking dairy products, look for 
  soy, rice, almond, or oat milks which do NOT have harmful chemicals in them. Milks from 
  grains are much better for the digestive system.</p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID SPRINKLING SALT ON YOUR FOOD RIGHT BEFORE EATING IT.</li>
  </u><p>Table salt can be in 2 forms: Inorganic and Organic. Organic is when salt is added 
  in during cooking. Inorganic is when the salt is sprinkled on food right before eating as 
  many Americans do before they eat their steak. Inorganic is the harmful type of salt. Salt 
  has a high osmotic pressure, that is to say it has a </font>¡¥<font FACE="Arial">sucking</font>¡¦ 
  <font FACE="Arial">force. Salt that is sprinkled on food before eating dissolves directly 
  on the tongue and from the tongue goes directly into the blood bypassing the digestive 
  system. Since salt has a </font>¡¥<font FACE="Arial">sucking</font>¡¦ <font FACE="Arial">property, 
  it will cause water retention in the body leading to high blood pressure. That is why the 
  first thing medical doctors do when they treat high blood pressure is to take the person 
  off salt. Avoid sprinkling salt directly on your food right before eating. It is not good 
  for you and you don</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">t need it.</p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID WHITE BREADS, PRESERVATIVES, AND ADDITIVES. EAT WHOLE GRAINS.</li>
  </u><p>The number of chemicals in modern foods are overwhelming. Just read the label of 
  ingredients on your typical loaf of bread and you</font>¡¦<font FACE="Arial">ll see why. 
  White bread has little nutrition and is constipating. Try to buy breads that are made with 
  WHOLE grains and no preservatives. The best place to buy this is at a health food store. 
  It will be more expensive, but I believe good health is priceless. Whole grains possess 
  nutrition that cannot be artificially fortified and naturally promotes bowel regularity. 
  Sodium Nitrite is used in all cured meats such as salami, pepperoni, hot dogs, etc</font>¡K<font FACE="Arial">. This chemical mixes with substances in the stomach and can cause stomach 
  cancer. There are other additives far too many to mention. The bottom line is: avoid 
  chemical additives as much as possible if you value your health.</p>
  <u>
  <li>AVOID FRUIT JUICES THAT ARE FROM CONCENTRATE. </li>
</ol>
</u>

<p>When buying fruit juices, there are 2 main types. One is from concentrate, the other is 
not from concentrate. Always try to buy NOT from concentrate. The concentrate juice is 
full of sugar and this has already been discussed previously. Juices NOT from concentrate 
are better for you.</p>

<p>So what is a proper diet? This is difficult to explain in detail. <u>Basically, the 
more natural it is, the better. The more processed it is, the worse it is. </u>One should 
eat a whole variety of foods, but never too much of one food. It is also good to get foods 
that have a variety of the five flavors. (The typical American diet contains too much 
sweet and salty taste.) The five flavors are sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty. </p>

<p>By following the basic principles outlined here, many diseases can be prevented. It is 
my belief (and other practitioners in the natural healing arts) that improper foods cause 
disease. Prevention is the best medicine. Disease comes from a long period of improper 
eating and lifestyle. Everyone should avoid the processed foods of modern civilization and 
return to natural foods from the past centuries. </p>
