<p>The recent terrorist attacks and threat of possible further attacks can be a cause of 
worry and confusion. There has been a run on gas and filter masks in the general public as 
a prevention of the potential biological warfare that is being reported in the news. Most 
Americans believe that our enemies have the capability to wage this type of warfare on us. 
The question is, </font><font SIZE="3">¡§</font><font color="#FF0000" FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">What can I do to protect myself and my family in the event of release of disease 
causing agents?</font><font SIZE="3">¡¨ </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">Traditional 
Chinese Medicine has documented centuries of treatment against historical diseases that 
ravaged China</font><font SIZE="3">¡¦</font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">s countryside. 
The basic underlying theory behind herbal medicine treatment is that all external 
pathogens must enter the body from the outside. Our body</font><font SIZE="3">¡¦</font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">s immune system must fight off this invasion to keep the pathogens 
from going deeper into the body thereby producing the symptoms associated with diseases 
that can result in death.</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine works to significantly strengthen the body</font><font SIZE="3">¡¦</font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">s immune system so that external pathogens 
cannot produce disease. If symptoms are present, herbs can help the body dispel those 
specific symptoms. Herbs can also assist the body in releasing the pathogens.</p>

<p>Here are some of the symptoms people may experience when exposed to external pathogens:

  <ul>
    <li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3"><font color="#FF0000">body aches</font></font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3"><font color="#FF0000">stiff neck</font></font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3"><font color="#FF0000">chills and fever</font></font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3"><font color="#FF0000">sweating or lack of sweating</font></font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3"><font color="#FF0000">sore throat</font></font></li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000" FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">nausea/vomiting</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="3">

<p>Because of modifications that may have been done on some of these pathogens, invasion 
can occur very quickly so it is important to notice symptoms and take the herbal flu 
medicine at the first sign of sickness. Having the herbs at hand will allow you to start 
treatment of your flu symptoms immediately. The herbs will start the process of dispelling 
the pathogens, but herbal tea may be necessary to complete the process. Therefore, we 
recommend that you have on hand sufficient powder for the whole family to treat the 
initial onset of symptoms. Ingesting the powder will also give you additional time to cook 
the herbal tea. Anyone still having symptoms after taking the powder will need to drink 
the tea. This should give you time to come visit our office. We can confirm your flu 
diagnosis and if necessary give you stronger herbs. The following are herbal medicines in 
the emergency kit: </p>
