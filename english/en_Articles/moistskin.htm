<p ALIGN="CENTER">MOIST SKIN PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that moist skin disorders (eczema) are caused 
allergens but also recognizes that it often occurs for no known reason. Some 
Western Medical physicians believe the causes are from genetic or psychological 
factors.</p>
<p>Western Medicine uses oils or lotions on the affected areas to keep the skin 
soft. In many cases, antihistamine drugs for itching, corticosteroid drugs for 
pain, and antibiotic drugs for infections are prescribed.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the body¡¦s muscles and moisture 
circulation is controlled by the spleen. Ordinarily, the excess moisture in the 
body is released through the bowels, however, lack of exercise and consumption 
of excessive amounts of sweet or sour foods will cause the moisture to be 
released through the skin. This may look like a skin disease but the problem is 
actually deeper in the muscles.</p>
<p>Treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine will use herbs to strengthen the 
kidney¡¦s to maintain good water circulation, decrease the temperature in the 
small intestine, eliminate excess moisture from the large intestine, absorb 
excess moisture, and stop itching. Steroids will damage the kidneys and must be 
avoided.</p>
