<p ALIGN="CENTER">LOW BACK PAIN PROBLEMS</p>
</b>
<p>Western Medicine believes that lower back pain is caused by a mechanical 
disorder affecting the structure of the back. These disorders include herniated 
discs, ligament strain, or muscle spasms. A herniated disk supposedly puts 
excessive pressure on the nerves causing pain. X-rays are required to help 
diagnose for any fractures or displacements of the spine. MRI tests or 
myelograms (dye injections for x-ray tests) are also used to help determine if 
herniated discs may be the cause.</p>
<p>Acute episodes of back pain are often treated by offering heat or cold 
treatments, pain killers and muscle relaxants to ease the pain. If a herniated 
disc is diagnosed, traction therapy (gradual pulling apart the upper and lower 
portions of the body) may be offered on a regular basis to help relieve the 
pressure of the herniated material upon the sciatic nerve. In many cases where 
herniated discs are found, surgery is often recommended. Lower back surgery is a 
delicate operation in which the tough ligaments along the spine are sliced and 
held open. Bone cutting forceps will then remove part or all of the adjacent 
spinal process so that the spinal cord can be gently pushed to the opposite side 
of the vertebra allowing the disk prolapse to be seen and removed. Additionally, 
metal rods or sections of bone from other parts of the body may be used to fuse 
vertebrae¡¦s together to help stabilize the spine.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the body can eliminate pain 
without unnecessary surgery or drugs. Lower back pain is not always a result of 
structural disorders. There are many individuals who have severe structural 
disorders of the lower back, including herniated disks, yet have no back pains. 
There are also many who have no signs of structural disorders of the back, yet 
have excruciating pain. Acupuncture is often used to relieve any type of pain. 
When the meridian blockages are eliminated, the body¡¦s circulation will 
improve and the pain will subside. If patients haven¡¦t had surgery, 
acupuncture in conjunction with herbs will give good results. Herbal medicines 
are used to help improve circulation, eliminate bruises, and strengthen the 
spine and bone. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that surgery will result 
in permanent damage and change acute pain into chronic. Over time, taking 
painkilling drugs will cause constipation and eventually cause liver and kidney 
damage.</p>
