</font>

<p> Have you 
been told by a Western Science Medical Doctor that you are healthy or normal, but you know 
you aren't? The problem may be that by many MD's criteria, if your laboratory tests come 
back within normal limits then you are normal, even if you don't feel good and know that 
something is wrong. People spend a lot of time and money trying to find a MD to diagnose 
them. They will travel from doctor to doctor until finding a doctor to tell them that yes, 
you are sick. For some conditions new diseases are named because so many people are 
suffering from similar problems without distinctive laboratory test results. Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome is recognized now as a condition. Thirty years ago, this condition was 
not listed as a disease. Traditional Chinese Medical Healers do not rely on disease names 
or laboratory tests to tell us if you are unhealthy. We can tell by examination. A 
Traditional Chinese Medical examination consists of Questioning, Pulse taking and visual 
inspection of tongue and eyes. The results of the examination tell us what is going on in 
your body and we use this information to prescribe Acupuncture, Herbal formulas, lifestyle 
changes and exercises. If you have been told by a practitioner that you are healthy, take 
our simple Good Health Quiz to see if we would agree. Our belief is that you have to know 
what is good health in order to recognize when a patient is not in balance and needs 
treatment. </p>
