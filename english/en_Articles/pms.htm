    <li>Seizures</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p> Most women experience only some of the above symptoms, and may not  
experience these symptoms every month.</p> 

<p> Western Science medical theory states that if no other physiological  
condition is present to account for any of the above symptoms, then the symptoms are  
assumed to be normal manifestations of hormonal fluctuations. This is a far cry from the  
accepted view in the Fifties and early Sixties that if a woman had any problems associated  
with her menstrual cycle, she was not a natural woman, i.e. she was not content with her  
lot in life and needed psychological counseling for her PMS. Unfortunately, while both the  
earlier and more recent views are not correct, the earlier view is closer to the mark. I  
don't mean that women can cure their PMS by becoming 1950 model housewives, but that PMS  
is not a normal state for women. If a woman's body is in balance, she should not  
experience PMS. In fact, PMS is an important symptom to the Traditional Chinese  
Practitioner. PMS tells us that Stagnation of Liver Qi caused by Toxins may be present.  
Liver Qi Stagnation can lead to constipation. Liver Qi Stagnation can exert abnormal  
pressure on the Spleen causing fluid balance problems such as bloating, edema, diarrhea,  
joint problems. Liver Qi Stagnation can lead to Liver Fire Rising which produces  
irritability and headaches. Liver Fire Rising can worsen into Liver Yang Rising and  
produce extreme anger, depression and mood swings. Liver Wind (Seizures) can occur. If  
Toxins in the Liver can't be cleared through the stool, skin eruptions can occur or  
worsen. As you can see, most of the problems associated with PMS, according to Traditional  
Chinese Medical Theory, actually arise from imbalances in the Liver. So the question  
becomes, where do these imbalances come from and how do we get the Liver back into  
balance?</p>

<p>  
HOW THE LIVER GETS OUT OF BALANCE</p> 

<p>  
There are basically three ways that Liver Qi can become stagnated: 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>TOXINS</li>
        <li>ANGER</li>
        <li>WEAK KIDNEYS</li> 
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>  
There are other ways that Liver Qi stagnation can occur, but I believe that the above  
three are the most common seen in American Women.</p> 

<p>  
TOXINS
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p> The easiest way the Liver  
    gets out of Balance is by the Toxins we consume in our daily diets. Toxins are defined as  
    any thing we ingest that is not natural. Most people think of additives, dyes and  
    preservatives as toxins, and they would be correct. However, unneeded Vitamin and Mineral  
    Supplements also become a burden to our Liver and will also be viewed in many individuals  
    as a Toxin. Unless you are lucky enough to consume only Kosher foods, Certified Organic  
    Foods, Range fed meats, fish from unpolluted waters, etc, you, like the vast majority of  
    Americans are ingesting daily additives that you aren't even aware. Our fresh vegetables  
    and fruits are sprayed, waxed and fed varieties of chemicals to force them to ripen and  
    then hold their color and shape through picking, shipping and storage. Our animals raised  
    for meat are given growth additives and antibiotics to get them to mature sooner and to  
    resist diseases. Some of these growth stimulants are steroid hormones that stay with the  
    animal all the way to the table. So this means we eat these chemicals in larger amounts  
    than we think each day. Why is Breast Cancer growing so fast in women of the  
    industrialized nations? (Especially America) Is there a relationship between our Country's  
    Cancers and the hormones we ingest in our food? I believe the answer is yes, there is a  
    connection. </p>
    <p> Our body, when  
    it should have to digest only the food we eat, has to detoxify after every meal. If we are  
    taking Vitamins and Minerals and other supplements, the Liver has to process these added  
    burdens as well. The Liver detoxifies the food, denaturing it for disposal through the  
    stool or bile. If the gallbladder is not working properly and/or constipation is present,  
    Toxins build up in the Liver ‘<font color="#FF0000"><u><big>clogging the works</big></u></font>’  
    so to speak. The Liver can't function properly. One of the important jobs of the Liver in  
    Chinese Medical Theory is to keep Qi circulating. If the Liver isn't functioning properly,  
    Qi stagnates. The first place it stagnates is in the Liver.</p> 
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>  
ANGER
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p> In  
    Chinese Medical Theory, each Organ is associated with an emotion. Emotions are produced by  
    dysfunction of the Organ and the Emotion itself can actually damage the organ. The emotion  
    associated with the Liver is Anger. In our hectic society, it is very easy to become  
    stressed. Our body is programmed to respond to stress in one of two ways—we either fight  
    or run away. It is very difficult if you are sitting in a traffic jam at 5:30 PM, its hot  
    and your car is over heating, horns are honking and you are late to pick up your child at  
    daycare, not to get stressed. You can't run away and it isn't appropriate to fight. So the  
    stress turns to anger and harms the Liver. As mentioned above, when the Liver is damaged,  
    Qi stagnates.</p> 
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>  
Weak Kidneys 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p> In  
    Chinese Medical Theory, each Organ has a Mother and a Son. The Mother of the Liver is the  
    Kidney. The Kidney is supposed to supply support to the Liver. However, if the Kidney  
    becomes weak, it will actually start to drain the Liver. What hurts the Kidney is Fear,  
    overwork, and excessive sex. Some people are born with weak Kidneys because their mother  
    or father had depleted their Kidney by one of the above. We know when our Kidney is  
    damaged if we suffer from fatigue, lower back pain, frequent urination, cold feet and  
    hands. Lower back pain is an epidemic in America, and I believe this is from Kidney  
    Deficiencies. If a woman is suffering from a Deficient Kidney, then her Liver will be  
    affected. Qi Stagnation can then occur. </p>

<p>  
HOW TO GET BACK INTO BALANCE AND STAY THERE 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p>If a woman is suffering from PMS, usually Herbal treatment is necessary to restore the 
    body's balance. Acupuncture is needed for acute symptoms such as bloating, edema,  
    cramping. After evaluation, the practitioner may prescribe Acupuncture and/or Herbs.  
    Usually, the woman will need treatment through a couple of cycles. Because each woman is  
    unique, the herbal treatment will be tailored for her symptoms. How long the treatment  
    will take can only be determined by the woman's body. If the PMS is fairly recent and has  
    its origins in Liver Toxins, treatment may be fairly quick, one or two cycles. If the PMS  
    has been going on for a long time and it's origins are from Kidney Deficiency, treatment  
    may take longer, as the Kidneys have to be restored to function as well as Liver Qi  
    Stagnation resolved. But once the PMS symptoms are gone, it is important for the woman to  
    understand how to prevent them from returning.</p> 
  </ul>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Eliminate toxins as much as you can from your diet. This means decrease the amount of  
    processed dyed, artificial, preservative food as you can. Decrease the types and amounts  
    of unnecessary Vitamin, Mineral and supplements. In order to assist your body in  
    eliminating the toxins you do ingest, drink plenty of Green Tea daily. This assists the  
    Liver in detoxifying the things you ingest.</li> 
  <li>Learn to deal with Stress in a positive manner. If you know you are prone to long  
    traffic jams, adjust your routes, play motivational tapes in your car, practice breathing  
    exercise, anything so you don't sit and stew. If you have a job or relationship that is  
    stressful, consider your alternatives. Exercise in a manner that doesn't provoke pain or  
    excessive tiredness can also help counter stress in our life. Yoga, Tai Chi, QI Gong,  
    Martial Arts, swimming, etc are forms of exercises that force you to breathe properly in  
    order to perform. Proper breathing will also help counter our body's response to stress.</li> 
</ol>

<p> All things in moderation  
will prevent damage to our Kidneys. In our modern societies, fear can be a neighbor,  
especially when you read the papers and watch the news. Fear is very damaging to our  
Kidneys. A good belief system will help in overcoming fears of modern life. If our kidneys  
are strong, Fear is not a factor in our lives</p>
